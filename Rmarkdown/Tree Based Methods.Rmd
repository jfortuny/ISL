# 8.3 Lab: Decision Trees

The *tree* library is used to construct regression and classification trees. We also use the *ISLR* package for the sample data.

```{r}
library(tree)
library(ISLR)
attach(Carseats)
View(Carseats)
```

## 8.3.1 Fitting Classification Trees

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
